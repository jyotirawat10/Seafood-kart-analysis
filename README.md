Seafoodcart Analysis
As part of a recent analysis for SeafoodCart data, I developed three interactive dashboards using Power BI to uncover valuable insights into user behavior, product performance, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Here’s a breakdown of the analysis:

User Behavior Dashboard
This dashboard provided insights into how customers interact with the website. We tracked which pages attracted the most visits and identified trends in customer behavior over time. Additionally, we monitored the impact of marketing campaigns, assessing how they influenced traffic and engagement.

Product Performance Dashboard
This dashboard focused on product categories, helping us understand which products were receiving the most views and purchases. This insight allowed the team to identify popular products and potential areas for improvement, providing a clear direction for inventory management and targeted marketing efforts.

Campaign Effectiveness Dashboard
The final dashboard analyzed the success of marketing campaigns. By looking at the performance of specific products in relation to campaign events, we were able to assess whether the campaigns were delivering expected results. This insight helped guide future campaign strategies for better outcomes.

By combining these three dashboards, we were able to provide SeafoodCart with actionable, data-driven insights that supported key business decisions—from improving customer experience to optimizing marketing strategies. The visualizations offered a clear view of trends and performance, empowering the team to make informed decisions and drive growth.
